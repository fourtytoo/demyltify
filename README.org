* DEMYLTIFY: a milter library in Common Lisp

This is a Common Lisp library to implement milters.  A milter is a
Sendmail filter (hence the contraction); a daemon program that extends
and augments the Sendmail functionality and implements features that
are not provided by Sendmail itself, such as spam filtering, virus
protection, mail archiving, mailing lists etc.  Matter of fact, much
of the logic behind Sendmail routing and access control could, in
fact, be off loaded to a milter or a composition of milters.

Milters are usually C programs linked to the libmilter library, which
comes with Sendmail.  Interfacing to such library is not always an
option, especially for many Lisp systems.

The libmilter library implements the milter protocol, the
(de)serialisation of the data and the multi-threading.  This is what
demyltify does as well, in a more lispy style.

Milters written with demyltify don't need to be multi-thread.  It's up
to you whether, in the =ON-CONNECTION= callback, to spawn a new
thread, fork a new process, or simply do nothing special to handle
Sendmail connections.


** How it works

The program calls =START-MILTER= passing a port number and a function.
The milter library binds a socket to that port and waits for Sendmail
connections.

For each connection, the milter library calls the callback function
that was provided to =START-MILTER=, passing a socket.  The callback,
in turn, must call =SERVER-LOOP= with the context object that usually
will contain further state data and milter options such as the
protocol options.

On each event received from Sendmail, the library calls the relevant
handler (method).  Each event method accepts an event object and a
context object, and returns an action object.


** To install and compile

  - link demyltify.asd into your ASDF system directory
  - start your Lisp
  - ~(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :demyltify)~


** Usage

To use this library, all you have to do is:

  - write your own context class inheriting from =MILTER-CONTEXT=
  - specialise the =HANDLE-EVENT= methods on your =MILTER-CONTEXT=
    class for all the events you care about (the default definition
    will simply let any mail through)
  - call =START-MILTER=

The default options negotiation method will signal an error condition
if the MTA doesn't fully support the milter prerequisites.  This is a
sensible behaviour considering that, if the MTA doesn't match the
performed actions and required events of the milter, there is very
little the milter can do about it; it will simply not work.

=HANDLE-EVENT= methods must return an action symbol or object which
will be sent to the MTA.  The action without arguments are specified
as keywords.  Those are

  + =:CONTINUE= get on with the next event
  + =:ACCEPT= accept the message
  + =:REJECT= bounce the message
  + =:DISCARD= silently ignore the message
  + =:PROGRESS= hang on, the milter is performing some lengthy computation
  + =:TEMPORARY-FAILURE= the message can't be processed by the milter because of a temporary problem

This library is mostly stateless, so the program, if needs to, is
responsible to save its state in the context object.  To do that you
are supposed to write your own context class which inherits from
=MILTER-CONTEXT= and pass it to =START-MILTER=.

The lifetime of a context object is the same as the Sendmail
connection.  The user program has to make sure that it resets whatever
state, in the context, that is message-specific, at every message
boundary.  Usually good places are the =MAIL= or the
=END-OF-MESSAGE= / =ABORT= handlers.

=START-MILTER= is a procedure that never exits under normal
circumstances.  It enters a loop serving MTA connections on the
specified socket.  It is appropriate for the =ON-CONNECTION= function to
fork or fire a new thread. You don't need to use =START-MILTER=, if you
want to write your own server function, go ahead, but for most
practical purposes it does what you need to connect to Sendmail.

*** The event handlers

The event handlers are CLOS methods specialised on the event type and
the context.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp -n
  ;; here we add up the byte count per message
  (defmethod handle-event ((e event-body) (ctx my-context))
    (incf (ctx-byte-count ctx) (length (event-body-data e)))
    keep-going)

  ;; at the beginning of each message we reset the counter
  (defmethod handle-event ((e event-mail) (ctx my-context))
    (setf (ctx-byte-count ctx) 0)
    keep-going)
#+END_SRC

The events a milter can handle are:

 - =EVENT-ABORT= when Sendmail aborts the current message (others may follow)
 - =EVENT-BODY= a chunk of the message body (passed the headers)
 - =EVENT-CONNECT= when a client MTA connects to our Sendmail
 - =EVENT-DATA= marks the beginning of the message body
 - =EVENT-DISCONNECT= Sendmail wishes to disconnect but it will connect
   again later
 - =EVENT-END-OF-HEADERS= to signal the end of the email's headers part
 - =EVENT-END-OF-MESSAGE= at the end of a message body
 - =EVENT-HEADER= for each email header
 - =EVENT-HELLO= when Sendmail sees a HELO from its client
 - =EVENT-MAIL= when Sendmail receives a MAIL command from its client
 - =EVENT-QUIT= when Sendmail asks the milter to lay down and die
 - =EVENT-RECIPIENT= for each recipient on the email envelope
 - =EVENT-UNKOWN= invalid SMTP command from Sendmail's client

Internally the milter library handles the following events.  In normal
circumstances you shouldn't bother with them:

 - =EVENT-DEFINE-MACRO= definition of symbolic values that supplement
   other events
 - =EVENT-OPTIONS= negotiation of event and actions between Sendmail and
   the milter

A context class derives from a =MILTER-CONTEXT= like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp -n
  ;; we specialise the context to add the byte count per message
  (defclass my-context (milter-context)
    ((byte-count :accessor ctx-byte-count)))
#+END_SRC


*** Milter start

To start the milter you simply call =start-milter= and you pass the
internet port and the connection callback.  The callback will be
called with a socket as argument and, in turn, it should call
=server-loop= passing a milter context of your choice.  Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp -n
  (defun start-milter-loop (socket)
    (be context (make-instance 'my-context
                               :socket socket
                               :events '(:mail :body)
                               :actions '(:add-header))
      (server-loop context)))

  (defun start-my-milter ()
    (let ((*log-file* #P"mymilter.log"))
      (start-milter 20025 #'start-milter-loop)))
#+END_SRC


*** Macros

Sendmail before some events passes some additional data to the milter.
This data is in form of values associated to a symbolic name
(macro) such as =mail_host=, =_= (the connection host), =rcpt_mailer=,
=rcpt_host=, etc.  An association list, at the end of the day.

A milter may access these values with the =GET-MACRO= function,
passing the current context and the macro name as a string.  Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp -n
  (let ((host (get-macro ctx "_")))
    (format t "Got connection from ~A~%" host))
#+END_SRC

In an =EVENT-RECIPIENT= handler method it might be used like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp -n
(defmethod handle-event ((event event-recipient) (ctx my-context))
  (push (make-recipient :address (extract-mail-address (event-recipient-address event))
			:mailer (get-macro ctx "rcpt_mailer")
			:host (get-macro ctx "rcpt_host"))
	(ctx-my-recipients ctx))
  :continue)
#+END_SRC



*** Sendmail configuration

To install a milter in Sendmail, in /etc/mail/sendmail.mc, you have to
add a line like these:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`filter1', `S=unix:/var/run/demyltify.socket, F=T')
  INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`filter2', `S=inet:20025@localhost, F=T')
#+END_EXAMPLE

and compile the .mc into a .cf file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n
  cd /etc/mail
  make
  make install restart
#+END_SRC

Then make sure you use the same address in the call of
=START-MILTER=:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp -n
  (start-milter #P"/var/run/demyltify.socket" #'my-connect-callback)
  (start-milter 20025 #'my-start-milter-loop)
#+END_SRC

The ~F=T~ flag tells Sendmail to treat milter-related errors (ie milter
not listening or crashing) as temporary.  Read the Sendmail's
cf/README file if you need further details.

Sendmail does not start the milters.  You have to do that yourself at
boot time (anyhow, before Sendmail needs them to process a message).

There is also a version of this library for Clojure, which is
available on GitHub at http://github.com/fourtytoo/demyjtify


** Gotchas

This work is based on an informal description of the undocumented
Sendmail-milter protocol.  This code may therefore be outdated right
now, as the Sendmail folks don't want you to mess with their protocol.
They rather want you to use their pthread-based libmilter library in
C.  Although, in practice, it's unlikely that this code will be
invalidated by the next few Sendmail versions, you never know.

This code has been tested on SBCL, CMUCL and CLISP.  Porting to
other Lisp systems should be fairly easy.
